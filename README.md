Coffee Run

This game is intended to be a cozy top-down RPG in which the player delivers coffee to various characters. 

The narrative focuses on the player character, who notices something amiss in the town. Everyone around her is acting sluggish and tired. After making her way into the city, she finds out that the owner of the coffee shop has lost his keys, locking himself out of the shop. The player locates and returns the keys, causing the coffee shop to open. In return for finding the keys, the coffee shop provides an excess of coffee. The character then decides to help everyone out by bringing them coffee. 

Mechanics: 
The player interacts with the world around them by pressing E. Players can pick up objects with Q and give items with R. 

Aesthetics: 
Because we focused on the COFFEE keyword in the lab assignment, we wanted to recreate the comfortable feeling from inside a coffee shop. The town has a cozy but modern vibe, using pixel art for all of the sprites in the game. The global light is dimmed and each NPC has their own spotlight, giving them each a glow. Triggerable lamp posts around the map also add to the cozy, dreary vibe. 

Joys: 
Developing the plot was fun, since we didn’t go into it with any kind of plan. It was also fun to learn about the different ways to make and use tile maps to customize the game’s landscape. Building the environment was definitely the highlight of our development experience.

Struggles: 
It was a bit of a pain to coordinate all of the dialogue options with the various characters. We wanted the characters to say different things based on whether they were caffeinated or not, so we had to plan out ways to switch their dialogue assets. We also struggled slightly with collision detection and triggering interactions between the player and the environment.

Contributions:
Both of us contributed to building the environment as well as developing the dialogue and dialogue panel. Leigh added the moving cars to the map, various characters, and the coffee shop. Leigh also implemented audio and the particle system associated with the coffee. Kate adjusted the camera to follow the player’s movement and created various spotlights for the player and NPCs. Kate also added various cues and triggers into the environment to guide the player to various game milestones.
